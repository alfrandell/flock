hi, here is the two dimensional version of the Predator prey simulation

I am trying to make Bots that have life like Behavior . 

also trying to come up with an ecosystem that automatically 
stays in some kind of balance .

the directory structure is preserved in a zip file in this 2d version.

i have begun a 3 d version. so far, i have simplified the action so that 
the prey are spheres, and the predators are pointy cones trying to pop the spheres. i have simplified the flocking behavior, so that the prey are represented by spheres the size of their prefered flying distance.

they experience collisions like 3d billiard balls.
